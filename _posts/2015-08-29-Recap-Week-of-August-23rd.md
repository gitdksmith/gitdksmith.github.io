title: Recap Week of August 23rd
---

I have been told by many other students that this class is a lot of work, but well worth the effort. I am excited to be taking a course in which the skills we learn will be immediately applicable to work we would be doing outside of school. The truth cannot be said about many other courses I have taken. 

My first reaction to being in the class was the lack of students. This is the first computer science course that I have taken where not every seat in the room was filled. I feel that I have less programming experience than other CS students, the majority of my classes the last couple semesters being security or non programming intensive ones such as Network Security and Algorithms, but the instructor and TA’s seem encouraging enough. Having an internship over the summer, although it was focused on network monitoring and not programming, has also helped rid me of my fear of jumping into the deep end.

The two classes so far have been interesting and easy to comprehend. One thing that caught me off guard was the first time the instructor began calling random names to answer questions. Although the questions are not difficult, the thought of possibly being the next name to be called upon made me nervous. It seems, however, that it is not the instructor's goal to ridicule his students, and he will guide them to the correct conclusion to his questions with small hints if the student does not know the answer. 

Finally, I was excited to see that this blog would be a means of earning extra credit. I was hoping to use it as a way to study and recap each week’s material, but that excitement came crashing down upon learning that the blog is merely a reaction to the course, not about what we are learning. Either way, I have never kept a blog before and believe that this will be beneficial in forcing me to write more. I might also start a second blog focused on security where I will write about something I have learned from an article online, most likely from /r/hacking or /r/netsec, to force me to read more security related material.

###Tip of the Week
This is shamelessly stolen from a piazza post by Jesse Mao and En-Hsu Yen, but I was intrigued about the difference between an assertion and an exception. The most useful point I took from an answer in the stackoverflow link was that “exceptions address the robustness of your application while assertions address its correctness.” In other words, use exceptions to deal with user input where you might have incorrect input but should be able to recover from it, and use assertions to test something that should always be true.
