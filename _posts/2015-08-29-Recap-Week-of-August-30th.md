title: Recap Week of August 30th
---

The second week of class covered what we will be doing in the first project, [Collatz](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/projects/Collatz.html). The problem that we are solving is, given a range of numbers, which has the highest collatz length. For example, in the range 1 to 10, the number 6 has the highest collatz length of 9: 6 3 10 5 16 8  4 2 1. 

What seems to be more difficult regarding the project is not this problem, but being unfamiliar with what we are using in the project. For starters, not knowing github added a little bit of time to figure out how to use it, then making sure Travis CI was connected to that github account and whatnot. I also find the instructions for the project, although numerous, feel incomplete. An instruction may say to “<em>Make at least 5 commits, one for each bug or feature<em>”, but we have not reached a point in the project that we have any code to work with, making me doubt myself and wonder if I missed a step and should have already begun working on a file. Similarly, a .travis.yml file is required for Travis CI to run, but the file is not included in the instruction section and I took it from the section specifying what is required when submitting the project. I am not sure if I messed up somewhere and did not pull the file when I was supposed to, or if I just second guess myself too much and should just do whatever I need to make this work. 

Otherwise, just like last week, being in class is enjoyable. I still like that the instructor randomly asks questions because it makes me pay attention, read ahead on the sample code he is showing, and anticipate questions. 

###Tip of the Week

Start doing the readings. I was lazy this week and did not do the them, but questions that are asked in the daily quizzes are pulled from those readings.
