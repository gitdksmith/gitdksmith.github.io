title: Recap Week of August 30th
---

The second week of class covered what we will be doing in the first project, [Collatz](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/projects/Collatz.html). The problem that we are solving is, given a range of numbers, which has the highest collatz length. For example, in the range 1 to 10, the number 6 has the highest collatz length of 9: 6 3 10 5 16 8  4 2 1.
