title: Recap Week of September 6th
---

I only attended the Wednesday class this week in which we had a guest speaker, a former UT student that now worked for Bloomberg in New York. The person was a good speaker, but it meant little to me. The one biggest takeaway that I had from it was that there are a LOT of tools that software engineers use that each do one specific task, and each have an annoying name. The speaker emphasized learning different tools to be able to talk about them with recruiters, but that seems like a daunting task. Having never heard of these things, how is someone supposed to pick something to learn at random? We will learn different tools in this course, but if they are not part of the tool set that a specific company uses, then is what you learned wasted? Hopefully these tools do tasks that are common in the sofware engineering process, and that knowing one will be useful in using any other of that same task. 
*** Tip of the Week
When tracking down a bug, check your environment! Here is an article concerning hours wasted searching for a bug, only to find the problem was in how the environment was set up. To make a long story short, the person needed to include another file they had overlooked. When thinking about how I deal with bugs, this never crosses my mind. It may be a good thing to keep in mind now that I am entering the software developement world.
